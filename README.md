# E-Dictionary
This project is an e-dictionary program made through Windowbuilder for help students memorize Java syntax. The program includes functions where students can add, delete, edit, merge, switch between databases, etc. along with outputting the syntax in dictionary into a PDF form. There is also a few sample syntax for each account user when the user registrates an account inside the e-dictionary program so that it gives an example to the user in terms of how to use the program. The project is also used as my ITGS IA (Internal Assessment) for my IB Diploma, in which I scored a 26/30 (before moderation).

This program uses Eclipse Windowbuilder for the front end, with the DB Browser for SQLite program as the back-end used for database storage. A relational database is implemented.

## Breakdown

The four sections of the dictionary are cover_page (doc), documentation, product and screencast:

- `The screencast is a demo of how the product runs. It includes a demo of both the Front End and the backend (Sqlite Database)`
  
- `The documentation consists of a series of planning files involving communication between me and my client.`

## Using the E-Dictionary

The first step you will need to do is to clone the repository using the following command:

`-git clone https://github.com/repositor224/E-Dictionary.git`

If you receive the error "Pip is not recognized" on CMD, go download Git!

After download, go to Product >> SyntaxDictionary.bat. Change SyntaxDictionary.bat into txt and input the following text into the system:

`JavaRunningEnvironment\bin\java.exe -jar SyntaxDictionary.jar`

and convert the bat that you have done that.

You can complete the next step in one of the two ways:

(1) Extract the Product folder into D-disk, OR

To access the File:

1. Change the File Directory in the Database Implementation File into the File Directory you want
2. Open the Batch File located inside the "Product" Folder
