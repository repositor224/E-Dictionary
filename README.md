# E-Dictionary
This project is an e-dictionary program made through Windowbuilder for help students memorize Java syntax. The program includes functions where students can add, delete, edit, merge, switch between databases, etc. along with outputting the syntax in dictionary into a PDF form. There is also a few sample syntax for each account user when the user registrates an account inside the e-dictionary program so that it gives an example to the user in terms of how to use the program. The project is also used as my ITGS IA (Internal Assessment) for my IB Diploma, in which I scored a 26/30 (before moderation).

This program uses Eclipse Windowbuilder for the front end, with the DB Browser for SQLite program as the back-end used for database storage. A relational database is implemented.
